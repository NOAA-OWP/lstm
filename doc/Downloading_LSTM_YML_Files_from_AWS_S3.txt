How to Download Many Files from AWS S3 Bucket
-----------------------------------------------

1.  Start the Cyberduck app.

2.  Server:  s3.amazonaws.com       Port: 443
    URL:     https://s3.amazonaws.com
    Access Key ID:   scottp
    Password:        ******

3.  It will then prompt for your AWS "Access Key ID" and
    "Secret Access Key".  (Stored in Keeper)

4.  Browse to:
    formulations-dev > HUC01 > LSTM
    Each file in the LSTM folder is a YML config file for a
    particular HUC01 catchment (e.g. cat-67.yml), with just
    a few lines of parameter settings.

5.  If you try to list the files in LSTM folder (i.e. cat-*.yml),
    it will ask about listing over 5000, then over 10,000 files.
    You can say Yes.  But you don't need to list the files, you
    can copy the whole folder (by dragging to your desktop).
    This set of YML files is not very big, but still takes a
    while (roughly 10 minutes) to download them all.
    Total number of files:  14,633
    Total file size:        4,630,899 B (4.6 MB)

6.  Copied this LSTM folder to:
        ngen/extern/lstm_py/bmi_config_files/HUC01

7.  The files: catchment_data.geojson and nexus_data.geojson can
    be found in:  formulations-dev > HUC01.  They are also needed.
    Copied them into:  ngen/data
    with the new names:
        catchment_data_HUC01.geojson
        nexus_data_HUC01.geojson

    NOTE:  Each ID (e.g. "cat-27") that appears in:
        ngen/data/lstm/realization_config_lstm.json
    must have a corresponding entry in these two files.
    (So older versions of these geojson files may not work.)
