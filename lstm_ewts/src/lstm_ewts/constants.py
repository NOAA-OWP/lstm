"""
Constants and configuration keys for the Error Warning and Trapping System (EWTS).

This module defines all constant values used by EWTS for logging configuration,
environment variable integration, and log file naming. These values represent
the stable interface between EWTS, ngen, and participating Python modules.

Constants are grouped into two categories:

    1) Module-specific constants:
       Values that uniquely identify the current ngen module, including the
       logger name and module-specific environment variables.

    2) Common constants:
       Values shared across ngen modules that control global logging behavior,
       filesystem layout, and integration with the ngen runtime environment.

These constants are intentionally centralized to ensure consistent behavior
across the codebase and to avoid hard-coded strings in implementation logic.
Callers should treat these values as read-only.
