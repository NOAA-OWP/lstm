For use in NextGen, the lstm_py project folder should be copied into
the NextGen project folder, at ngen/extern/lstm_py, and the files.

This folder, "ngen_files", contains files that should be copied into the
ngen repo tree (or project folder), into the indicated subfolders.
This will allow the new LSTM Python package to be run from within NextGen.

The "ngen_files folder" contains:
(1) "realization config" files for NextGen in data/lstm folder
(2) catchment and nexus data GeoJSON files for HUCO1, CAMELS-test, etc.
(3) forcing data for testing HUC01, CAMELS-test, etc. in data/forcing
